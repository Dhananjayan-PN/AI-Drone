# AI-Drone
A simple and easy-to-use Python module that implements Object Detection and Machine Learning algorithms to the live camera feed of a DJI Tello drone in order to detect human faces.
The Object Detection further allows the program to instruct the drone to follow the object, in this case, a person.
The module can be modified to follow other types of objects, like car, animal, etc.
